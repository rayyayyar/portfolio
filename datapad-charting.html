<!--        Task and Problem-->
        <section>
          <p>Design was tasked to improve upon the existing prototype for a charting tool.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to trellis</li>
            <li>Ability to select between chart types</li>
            <li>Less implicit</li>
            <li>Filters</li>
            <li>Ability to directly map to attributes like color or size</li>
            <li>Scale, linear binning, set as category, frequency</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h3>Charting (Solution)</h3>
          <p>DataPad's charting tool aimed to be expressive, predictable, and explicit.</p>

          <h3>Charting (Before my time)</h3>
          <p>Before I put my hands into the product, the team had already a rough prototype built — a "pipeline to the backend" as I recall Wes humbly describing it.</p>

          <h3>Charting (Light Research)</h3>
          <p>Design started the process with some academic reading, exploration of existing charting tools, and discussions about what's best for DataPad.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tableau</li>
            <li>Lumira</li>
            <li>Platfora</li>
            <li>Microstrategy</li>
            <li>Birst</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the end, we borrowed heavily from Tableau's visualization principles, but remained consistent with both DataPad's design language and existing charting engine. In contrast to other tools, we aimed for flexibility in expressing data visually. DataPad's vision for the charting tool allowed users to visualize data at the speed of thought.</p>

          <h3>Designs</h3>
          <p>After initial review of existing tools in the market, I began exploring frameworks through sketching and visual mocks.</p>

          <img src="img/charting-iterations/charting-pivot-09-complete.png">
          
          <p>So that didn't really work because engineering would have no way of completing this in time.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>The very first cut of the charting tool concluded without the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Filters</li>
            <li>Chart type descriptions</li>
            <li>Trellis</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We later added these in piecemeal once development had more time.</p>
          <p>Minor pieces of the charting tool underwent design changes as the product evolved. The final cut (before DataPad stopped production) was built very close to spec and impressed users both inside and outside of the team.</p>
          <p>The main issues with DataPad's charting tool were associated with its unpredictability. Our charting engine was making some assumptions about how to best represent plotted data. While we were well on our way to making better assumptions and forming a more consistent framework for how data gets plotted, we did not manage to get there in the final cut. If design had continued, one key improvement would have included a tooltip wizard for each chart type (not unlike Tableau's).</p>
