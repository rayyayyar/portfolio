<!--    Task and Problem-->
        <section class="overview">
          <p>Design was tasked to create an onboarding process to help new users get started with DataPad. We had some key goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Help users get to the most valuable parts of the app in less than 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow secondary users to quickly connect and share data.</li>
            <li>Allow users to set up their company and invite others.</li>
            <li>Allow users to watch a brief video at some point to learn more about how to use DataPad.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>There was a process. I looked at onboarding designs from a variety of web products, compared, and contrasted the strengths and weaknesses of each.</p>
          <p>
            TUMBLR
             - Uses dotted placeholder containers to indicate future content
             - Focuses first on getting you to follow five blogs
             - Allows you to skip the suggested "follow five"
             - Uses spotlighting to focus on the next thing
             - Immediately lets you sign in after signup (email confirmation is still sent)
             - Pushes mobile app (with option to opt out) before letting user explore
             - Puts user into app to start onboarding
             - Prompts for avatar
          </p>
          <p>
            TRELLO
             - Immediately lets you sign in after signup (email confirmation is still sent)
             - The content is the tutorial
             - Uses Trello as a member so the activity stream is repopulated.
             - Uses the product as a to-do list for the user
             - Puts user into app to start onboarding
             - Uses gravatar
          </p>
          

          <p>
            QUORA
             - "Emerald City in the distance" shows the landing UI behind the onboarding modal
             - Uses unambiguous commands + associated benefits
             - Once on boarded after signing up, choosing topics, adding friends, shows to-do list on the right with already-completed items
             - Fails to fist bump user for finishing to-do items 
             - Uses a separate modal for first onboarding steps, then uses the app to teach user
          </p>
          <p>
             INVISION
              - Uses a modal on top of app UI to onboard users
              - Gives sample screens in case user has no screens handy
              - Includes sample projects
              - Preloads activity screen so there's no "There's nothing here"
              - Uses one-time tooltip helpers to point out options in project view
              - Drops you right into a project (demo or your own) right after onboarding
              - Uses default avatars (gravatar)
          </p>
          <p>
            BASECAMP
             - Uses a full screen as the first view before dropping into the app
             - Provides a sample project
             - Shows placeholder objects for where projects will show up
             - Uses default avatars
          </p>
          <p>
            MURALLY
             - On entrance, very focused action to get started with a new mural
             - Sample murals are provided in the sidebar
             - A video modal shows up on the first mural creation, with option to close
             - Progress indicator is shown for a to-do list http://d.pr/i/cPlu
             - Each item in the to-do list when clicked, spotlights the action http://d.pr/i/fOa7
          </p>
