        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>Over the span of two weeks, I kept track of the items I threw away. I extrapolated from this data to see how much trash would be left on Earth after my death (morbidly estimated age). Seeing that some types of materials take longer to decompose than others, it turned out to be an interesting visualization and a useful reminder about my footprint.</p>
