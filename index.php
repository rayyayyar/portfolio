	        <p class="text-justify">But seriously, I believe there's much more to design than just soft corners and flat aesthetics. As our world becomes more digital, we have increasingly more opportunity to design products that enhance the human experience. I love to build experiences that people fall in love with. For that to happen, I've learned just how important it is to truly understand who and what you are designing for.</p>

							<p>DataPad was a web app designed for teams to integrate, refine, analyze, explore, and share data. I led design efforts for all key features.</p>

							<p>Blippy existed as a short-lived web experiment for online video. It allowed people to create their own communities of video and video-watchers. I joined the team in August 2012 to lead all design efforts (UX, visual, research, interaction).</p>

							<h1>Thinkspace</h1>
							<p>In collaboration with SRI International, our team of four Masters students from Carnegie Mellon University set out to understand the learning dynamics between teachers and students in high school biology classrooms and how SRI's technology could be best applied. In the process, we prototyped an iPad application that helped students solve complex problems.</p>

							<h1>Age of Waste</h1>
							<p>Over the span of two weeks, I kept track of the items I threw away. I extrapolated from this data to see how much trash would be left on Earth after my death (morbidly estimated age). Seeing that some types of materials take longer to decompose than others, it turned out to be an interesting visualization and a useful reminder about my footprint.</p>
